          By default, all patients and professionals are considered as fully susceptible (neither vaccinated nor recovered).
          In this tab, you can specify the initial immunity state of your population.
          Your population will be randomly sampled based on probability weights define for each immunity level.
          You can choose to use national proportion as probabilities, or set you own probability.
          You can also choose to use different probabilities for different wards (for example,
          you may face different immunity populations in a paediatric ward and in a psychiatric ward).

          This tab is mainly reserved to epidemiologists, nevertheless if you want to take your chance here, you have access to all the model parameters.
          <br>
          Using this tab, you can change the daily incidence, the basic reproduction number (R0) and the average disease duration.
          Those parameters will affect the probability of contamination of professionals in the community (outside of work), as well as
          the probability to receive a infectious visitor.
          You can also adjust the national proportions and duration of each immunity and epidemiological stages,
          as well as the probability of receiving a vaccination dose.
          Finally, you can adjust the immunity efficiency.
          Epidemiological stages considered in this model are: susceptible (S), exposed but non contagious (E), exposed and contagious either before symptoms (ES) or before asymptomatic stage (EA), infectious either asymptomatic (IA), with mild symptoms (IM) or with severe symptoms (IS).
